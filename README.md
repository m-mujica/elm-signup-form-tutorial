# Building a Live-Validated Signup Form in Elm

This repository contains the code of this [tutorial](http://tech.noredink.com/post/129641182738/building-a-live-validated-signup-form-in-elm) by @rtfeldman; 
I just made some small changes like adding type annotations, union types for the `Actions` and a case expression in 
the `update` function.
